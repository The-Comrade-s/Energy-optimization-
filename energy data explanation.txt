The 'energy_data.csv' file is assumed to have the following columns:

temperature: Temperature reading in Celsius.
humidity: Humidity level as a percentage.
occupancy: Binary value indicating occupancy (1 if occupied, 0 if unoccupied).
consumption: Energy consumption value (target variable to predict).
Each row in the CSV file represents a sample or observation of the energy consumption data, with corresponding values for temperature, humidity, occupancy, and consumption.
